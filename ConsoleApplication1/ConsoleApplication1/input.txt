To test the function for finding the frequency of words in an input text file, I used the provided function countWordFrequency. The function takes two arguments: the input file name (input.txt) and the output file name (output.txt). I made sure that the input file, input.txt, was present in the same directory as the program. Running the program, it opened the input file, read it word by word, and counted the frequency of each word using an unordered_map. Then, it created an output file, output.txt, and wrote the word frequencies to it. Finally, the program displayed a message indicating that the word frequencies were successfully written to the output file. This confirmed that the function worked as expected and accurately calculated the frequency of words in the input file.
